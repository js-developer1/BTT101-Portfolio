				This project demonstrates my acquired skills of designing a website to entice customers to pay for a certain product. 
				It's a good artifact as this website follows the website designing rules and the acronym AIDA which stands for Attention, Interesting, Desire, and Action used to help design a website to get customers to buy your product.
				This can help me in the future as my knowledge on how to build a good website can lead me to build a website with my own products or this can show my future clients my acquired skills.

				This project demonstrates my acquired skills of designing an ergonomic desk setup and my ability to communicate effectively.
				It's a good artifact as the project includes a leter where we have to effectively and professionally explain that the person is hired and what their desk setup will look like which the desk setup should acount for ergonomics.
				This can help me in the future as I will need to communicate in business a lot so I need to be quick, professional, and effective. 
				The desk setup part of project can help me later as there is more to a desk setup than the the ability of the equipment so this will help me keep in mind the ergonomics aspect of it.
